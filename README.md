This repository contains the example code for the [Internationalization with vue-i18n
](https://vueschool.io/courses/internationalization-with-vue-i18n) course on [Vue School](https://vueschool.io).

Learn how to create multilingual websites and Vue.js applications with Vue i18n. Vue i18n is the official internationalization library from Vue.js that integrates nicely with any new or existing Vue.js application.

At first glance, internationalization can be quite daunting and challenging. That is if you don’t have a proper tool to help you.

With Vue i18n, we can automatically detect and set languages based on the user’s browser or URL. We can easily translate and transform text, numbers, dates, currencies, and so much more.

In this course, you’ll learn how to manage your translations with Vue CLI GUI, even if you didn’t use Vue CLI to scaffold your project.

**By the end of this course you’ll master**

- How to create multilingual websites with Vue.js
- How to organize your translation files
- How to use variables with your translated text
- How to work with translated text and pluralization
- How to handle different date and currency formatting for different languages and regions
- How to change the locale programmatically
- How to change the locale through the user interface
- How to persist the locale change
- And so much more
